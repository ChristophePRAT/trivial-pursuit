# Trivial Pursuit
## TL;DR
French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· trivial pursuit

You can play [here](trivial-pursuit-emc.vercel.app)!

## Motivation

As part of the EMC (moral education class) in my high school, the teacher requested that we build a personalized version of the classic [Trivial Pursuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivial_Pursuit) game with **democracy questions**.

This is the version which we handed in. Its intent is to ridicule the tensions between the USA and the USSR during the cold war.

## How to play
You can play with up to **30 friends**.

When the game starts, participants answer a question one by one and gain **1 point** if their answer is correct, **0 point** if it is false.

There are some **twists**: randomly, you will either have a bonus or malus, which make the game less repetitive and more fun!
